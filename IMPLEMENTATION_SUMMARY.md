# SciPris Chatbot Implementation Summary

## Enhancements and Features

### 1. Response Matching and Natural Language Understanding
- **Advanced Query Matcher**: Added `match_query_to_response()` function using regex patterns to map user queries to appropriate response categories
- **Unmatched Query Logging**: Implemented `log_unmatched_query()` to collect queries that couldn't be matched for continuous improvement

### 2. User Context Management
- **Session State Tracking**: Complete user session management with timeout and cleanup functionality
- **Frustration Detection**: Added patterns to detect signs of user frustration and provide empathetic responses
- **User Personalization**: Extraction of user names for personalized responses

### 3. DOI and Article Handling
- **Improved DOI Extraction**: Enhanced regex patterns for various DOI formats
- **Multiple Extraction Methods**: Fallback strategies for extracting article titles
- **Database Integration**: Flexible article lookup with case-insensitive and partial matching

### 4. System Architecture
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for database operations, JSON loading, and request processing
- **Health Monitoring**: Added `/healthcheck` endpoint for system monitoring
- **Session Cleanup**: Background task for removing expired sessions to prevent memory leaks
- **API Endpoints**: Structured API design with proper status codes and error responses

### 5. Deployment and Operations
- **Docker Support**: Added Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration for development and production
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx reverse proxy configuration for production deployment
- **Logging**: Structured logging for unmatched queries and user feedback

### 6. Testing and Quality
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite for utility functions and API endpoints
- **Test Coverage**: Tests for DOI extraction, query matching, and frustration detection
- **Realistic Test Data**: Sample database with realistic article information

### 7. Documentation
- **README**: Clear instructions for setup, configuration, and deployment
- **API Documentation**: Documented endpoints and their parameters
- **Environment Setup**: Requirements file with pinned dependencies
